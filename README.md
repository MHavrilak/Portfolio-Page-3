# Portfolio-Page-3

Updated portfolio page with showcased class projects


This is my third Porfolio Page revision. This first project was to build a Portfolio Page using html and CSS. The second project was to modify the first project with Bootstrap so as to add a Navbar and make the page mobile ready and responsive. This go around we are adding previous projects to showcase as well as styling the page to our own desired look.
